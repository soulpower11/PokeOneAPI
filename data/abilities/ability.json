This has significant consequences for properties determined by personality value.\r\n\r\nAs a result, when the encountered species can be affected by Cute Charm (i.e., when it is not a male-only, female-only, or genderless species), the chances of encountering a Shiny Pokémon differ from the usual 1/8192, depending on how many of the 25 possible values forced by Cute Charm result in a Shiny Pokémon (in conjunction with the Trainer ID number and Secret ID): they may be as low as 1/24546 (if none of the 25 values forced by Cute Charm result in Shiny Pokémon, so the Pokémon can only be Shiny if Cute Charm fails), or as high as 21.34% (if 8 out of the 25 values forced by Cute Charm result in Shiny Pokémon).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Spinda whose gender has been forced by Cute Charm in Generation IV only have one of 50 patterns (25 for male, 25 for female)."

Using a move through Dancer is a separate action to using the move originally selected. Dancer will not activate for a move copied by another Pokémon with Dancer, but it will activate on an instructed dance move.\r\n\r\nDancer is able to copy a status dance move that has been powered up into its corresponding Z-Move (e.g. Z-Feather Dance), but the Pokémon with Dancer copies the regular version of the move and does not gain the additional Z-Power effect.\r\n\r\nDancer will not activate if the move's animation does not play (assuming battle animations are on): if all of the move's targets are protected from it, the move fails to affect any Pokémon (e.g. Teeter Dance if all of the targets are already confused or have Own Tempo), or all targets are immune (e.g. Electric-type Revelation Dance if the target is Ground-type). Dancer will not activate if the move is stolen by Snatch.\r\n\r\nIf multiple Pokémon have Dancer when a dance move is used, the slowest Pokémon will move first (Lagging Tail and Full Incense are ignored), even during Trick Room.\r\n\r\nIf the Pokémon with Dancer is confused, it may hurt itself instead of copying the move, even if it is protected by a move like Protect or Mat Block. If a Pokémon has flinched, this also applies to moves it subsequently tries to copy with Dancer. A Pokémon with Dancer that is locked into a consecutively executed move (such as Petal Dance) or any move by Encore or a held Choice item will still try to copy the move, but will fail unless it is locked into that same dance move; if a Pokémon uses Petal Dance via Dancer while locked into Petal Dance, this usage does not count towards the 2-3 turn duration. If a Pokémon with Dancer is holding an Assault Vest, it can still successfully copy status dance moves.\r\n\r\nLunar Dance is copied after the original user faints. If a Pokémon copies Petal Dance via Dancer, it will not be locked into the move. If Feather Dance is reflected by Magic Bounce or Magic Coat, Dancer will not activate for either the initial usage of the move or its reflected use. If the Pokémon with Dancer is under the effect of Taunt, it will still try to copy a status dance move, but will fail.\r\n\r\nMoves used via Dancer can be stolen by Snatch and reflected by Magic Bounce and Magic Coat.

        "effect": "In battle.\r\nGeneration VI\r\nParental Bond causes most damaging moves used by the Pokémon to become two-strike moves, with the second attack being half as strong as the first. It does not affect multi-strike moves.\r\n\r\nIf a move could hit multiple targets (including allies), such as Earthquake and Rock Slide, it will not strike twice; however, if it can only hit a single Pokémon, such as in a Single Battle or if using a move that can hit multiple targets when only one target is in range, it will strike twice. If a move could hit multiple Pokémon but only hits one due to missing the other Pokémon, it will only strike once.\r\n\r\nAny attack which has a secondary effect (except Secret Power) has the same secondary effect on both strikes (such as Power-Up Punch), including effects that do not always trigger. If the Pokémon's Ability is changed to Mummy after the first strike, it will continue to make a second strike regardless. Since Parental Bond turns moves into two-hit multi-strike moves, each strike has a separate chance to be a critical hit, items and Abilities that trigger upon strike or contact such as Cursed Body and Rocky Helmet occur for each strike, and Spiky Shield and King's Shield only damage and decrease Attack (respectively) once if a Pokémon with Parental Bond uses a contact move against a Pokémon that has used one of them.\r\n\r\nUnlike other secondary effects, Secret Power's secondary effect can only occur after the second hit. If a move has recoil damage, the recoil will be based on the damage dealt by both strikes, but will be taken after the second strike; Struggle will inflict recoil damage equal to half the user's maximum HP (after the second strike). Circle Throw and Dragon Tail will strike twice, but only force the opponent to switch out once after both strikes are dealt. U-turn and Volt Switch strike twice, then the user switches out. Bug Bite and Pluck consume the target's Berry after the second strike, so if the target could eat its Berry due to low HP after the first strike, it will. Moves that require the user to recharge after use like Hyper Beam strike twice, and the user only needs to recharge for one turn. Smelling Salts, Wake-Up Slap and Knock Off do not cure the target of paralysis or sleep or remove the target's held item (respectively), until after the second strike, so both strikes get the increased power. Fire-type moves, Scald and Steam Eruption thaw a frozen target after the second strike (so a frozen target cannot be thawed and then burned by the same move). If Meloetta has Parental Bond and uses Relic Song, it will change Forme only once, after the second strike.\r\n\r\nIf Present heals the target it will only strike once, but if it damages the target it will strike twice (the second strike will always damage the target). Fixed-damage moves such as Seismic Toss and Dragon Rage deal the full amount of damage for both strikes. The damage dealt by Psywave is generated separately for each strike, and the second strike's damage is not halved. Each strike of Super Fang halves the target's HP (effectively quartering it if HP is not restored between strikes). Counter, Mirror Coat, Metal Burst and Bide deal the full amount of damage for both strikes. The first strike of Assurance counts as previously taking damage for the second strike, giving it increased power. Grass Pledge, Fire Pledge, and Water Pledge strike twice, even when used as a combination move. Natural Gift and Spit Up strike twice.\r\n\r\nFling, Self-Destruct, Explosion, and Final Gambit only strike once. Moves with a charging turn (such as Fly and Solar Beam) only strike once, even if the Pokémon becomes fully charged in one turn (such as with a Power Herb). Endeavor also only strikes once, even if the user or target's HP is changed after it strikes (such as by Iron Barbs or the Sitrus Berry). Confusion damage only occurs once.\r\n\r\nEven though the Ability makes the Pokémon strike twice, there is only one accuracy check for the strike. This means if the first strike misses there will be no second strike, and if the first strike does not miss, then the second is guaranteed to strike.\r\n\r\nGeneration VII\r\nThe second strike's damage was reduced, now dealing 25% of the damage of the first strike.\r\n\r\nParental Bond does not affect Z-Moves.\r\n\r\nOutside of battle\r\nParental Bond has no effect outside of battle."

        "description": "The stat changes the Pokémon receives are doubled.",
        "effect": "In battle\r\nGeneration IV\r\nSimple doubles the effectiveness of stat stages. For example, if Defense Curl is used, the screen will display that the user's Defense has increased by one stage and the game will store the user's Defense stage as +1, but the effect of that +1 stage will be equal to the effect of two regular stages and the user's Defense will be doubled during damage calculation. Similarly, if Tail Whip is used on this Pokémon, its Defense stat will fall one stage, but the effect will be treated as two.\r\n\r\nThe effect of stat stages cannot exceed their usual cap. For example, a Pokémon with Simple that has obtained +3 Defense stages will have quadrupled their Defense stat in damage calculation (the usual effect of +6 Defense); they can still continue to use a move like Defense Curl up to three more times to boost their Defense stage to +6, but these three additional stages will have no greater effect during damage calculation. The same applies to -3 Defense.\r\n\r\nBecause the stage numbers in-game have not changed, a Pokémon that uses Psych Up on a target with Simple only copies the stored (not doubled) stat stages. If a Pokémon uses Baton Pass to switch to a target with Simple, the target's passed stat stages will essentially gain double effect; if a Pokémon with Simple uses Baton Pass to a target without Simple, the target will not obtain any doubled stages. Similarly, if a Pokémon boosts its stats and then acquires Simple through a move like Skill Swap, its pre-existing effective stat changes will be doubled (barring caps) until it loses Simple.\r\n\r\nGeneration V\r\nSimple now directly doubles the number of stages that a stat is increased or decreased when the move, Ability, or item is used. For example, if Defense Curl is used, the screen will display that the user's Defense has increased by two stages (\"sharply rose\") and the game will store the user's Defense stage as +2, doubling the user's Defense as expected. Similarly, Tail Whip targeting a Pokémon with Simple will cause its Defense to directly drop by two stages.\r\n\r\nAs a result, moves like Defense Curl can only be used up to three times before they will fail (as the user's Defense stage will be the maximum of +6). If Psych Up is used on a target with Simple, the doubled stages will be copied. Using Baton Pass to a recipient with Simple will not cause the recipient to receive stat stages of double effect; if a Simple Pokémon uses Baton Pass itself, it will transfer the doubled stat stages. Similarly, if a Pokémon boosts its stats and then receives Simple through a move like Skill Swap, its pre-existing stat changes will not be doubled and nothing further will happen if it loses Simple.\r\n\r\nThe move Simple Beam can change the target Pokémon's Ability to Simple.\r\n\r\nGeneration VII\r\nStat stage increases caused by the Z-Power effects of status Z-Moves are not modified by Simple. However, the stat stage increases as a result of Extreme Evoboost and Clangorous Soulblaze are modified.\r\n\r\nOutside of battle\r\nSimple has no effect outside of battle."

Synchronize can be activated by other Pokémon's Abilities, such as Static and Synchronize itself; it cannot be activated by the Toxic Orb or Flame Orb.\r\n\r\nIf a Pokémon with Synchronize has a Berry that cures the status condition it was just inflicted with, Synchronize will activate before the Berry is eaten.\r\n\r\nGeneration III to IV\r\nWhen a Pokémon with Synchronize is badly poisoned by another Pokémon, that Pokémon will be inflicted with the regular poison condition.\r\n\r\nIf Psycho Shift is used by a burned, paralyzed, or poisoned Pokémon targeting a Pokémon with Synchronize, Synchronize activates after Psycho Shift cures the user of its status condition. Therefore, Synchronize will inflict the status condition anew in such a case.\r\n\r\nToxic Spikes do not activate this Ability unless a Pokémon on the field directly causes a Pokémon with Synchronize to switch in, such as by using the moves Roar or Whirlwind.\r\n\r\nGeneration V and VI\r\nWhen a Pokémon with Synchronize is badly poisoned by another Pokémon, that Pokémon will now be inflicted with the bad poison condition, rather than the regular poison condition.\r\n\r\nIf Psycho Shift is used by a burned, paralyzed, poisoned, or badly poisoned Pokémon targeting a Pokémon with Synchronize, Synchronize now activates before Psycho Shift cures the user of its status condition. Therefore, Synchronize will fail to inflict the status condition anew in such a case.\r\n\r\nToxic Spikes do not activate this Ability, even if another Pokémon forced the Pokémon with this Ability to switch in by using a move like Roar or Dragon Tail.\r\n\r\nOutside of battle\r\nFrom Pokémon Emerald onward, if a Pokémon with Synchronize is in the first place in the party (even if fainted) when a wild Pokémon is encountered, there is a 50% chance that the game will force it to have the same Nature as the Pokémon with this Ability. This does not apply to roaming Pokémon, Pokémon in the Pokéwalker, or Pokémon in the Entree Forest. In Emerald, it also does not apply to stationary Pokémon (such as Regirock or Rayquaza).\r\n\r\nIn SOS Battles, Synchronize may take effect on subsequently called allies if a Pokémon with Synchronize moves to the first place in the party during the battle. Due to a bug, however, the called Pokémon will Synchronize to the Nature of the Pokémon that was originally in the first spot.\r\n\r\nStarting in Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, if a Pokémon with Synchronize is leading the party, gift Pokémon (except Pokémon obtained via Mystery Gift) that are in the Undiscovered Egg Group will always have the same Nature as the Pokémon with this Ability. Starting in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, this applies regardless of the Pokémon's Egg Group; however, this does not apply to the Eevee Egg received at the Pokémon Nursery."

White Smoke does not prevent stat stages being directly modified by Heart Swap, Guard Swap, Power Swap, Baton Pass, or Topsy-Turvy.\r\n\r\nThis Ability is ignored by Pokémon with Mold Breaker, Teravolt, and Turboblaze.\r\n\r\nOutside of battle\r\nFrom Pokémon Emerald onwards, if a Pokémon with White Smoke is in the first place in the party (even if fainted), the chance of encountering a wild Pokémon is decreased by 50%.

This Ability will not activate if the HP of the Pokémon with this Ability is restored to above half immediately after it drops below half (such as due to a held Sitrus Berry).\r\n\r\nWimp Out will not activate if the Pokémon's HP falls below half by a move affected by Sheer Force.\r\n\r\nIt will activate only after the last hit of multi-strike moves, even if the HP of the Pokémon with this Ability drops below half before the last hit. If this Ability activates due to being hit by U-turn or Volt Switch, the user of that move will not be switched out. This Ability also will not activate if the Pokémon's HP falls below half while it is in the air during the semi-invulnerable turn of Sky Drop.\r\n\r\nTrapping moves do not prevent Wimp Out from activating.\r\n\r\nIf the Pokémon with Wimp Out holds a Red Card or Eject Button, the item activates first. Dragon Tail and Circle Throw switch out Pokémon before the Ability activates.\r\n\r\nWimp Out will not activate on the player's Pokémon in wild battles during trials.\r\n\r\nOutside of battle\r\nWimp Out has no effect outside of battle."
